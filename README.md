# munch-contract

Barebones contract.

This should be the MVP for our solidity contract

Missing:

- modifiable zkSync integration
- modifiable Chainlink integration

Done:

- Ability to delete eateries from our system (if they become uncertified)**
- Ability to adjust the basePay/munch reward if need be. (onlyowner function probably)

** changes eateries certified status to false instead of deleting.
