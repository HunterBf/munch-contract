# munch-contract

Barebones contract.

This should be the MVP for our solidity contract

Missing:

Ability to delete eateries from our system (if they become uncertified)
Ability to adjust the basePay/munch reward if need be. (onlyowner function probably)
redemption of $MNCH. allow user to request to purchase something on site/app (maybe have a queue/array made up...)
modifiable zkSync integration
modifiable Chainlink integration
